Best Practices and Style Guide
Bash Scripting: When Not to Use
Bash scripting is a powerful tool but has its limitations:

Complex Software Development: Bash may not be suitable for large projects. Higher-level languages are more appropriate.

Performance-Critical Applications: For high-performance requirements, consider languages compiled to machine code.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development: Bash is designed for the command line; GUI development is better suited for other languages.

API - Application Programming Interface
An API (Application Programming Interface) defines rules for software applications to interact. It specifies how requests and data should be structured for seamless communication.

REST API - Representational State Transfer API
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) follows principles like statelessness and standard HTTP methods. It facilitates internet communication, commonly used in web development.

Microservices Architecture
Microservices is an architectural style where an application comprises small, independent services. Each service focuses on specific business capabilities and communicates through APIs.

CSV Format - Comma-Separated Values
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple text format for storing tabular data. Each line represents a row, and values are separated by commas.

JSON Format - JavaScript Object Notation
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, easy for humans to read and write. Commonly used for data exchange in various applications.

Pythonic Naming Conventions
In Python, consistent naming conventions enhance readability:

Package and Module Name: Use "snake_case" (e.g., my_module).
Class Name: Use "CapWords" or "CamelCase" (e.g., MyClass).
Variable Name: Use "snake_case" (e.g., my_variable).
Function Name: Use "snake_case" (e.g., my_function).
Constant Name: Use "UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES" (e.g., MAX_VALUE).
Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
Using CapWords or CamelCase for class names in Python distinguishes them from other identifiers. It promotes readability, consistency, and is a cultural convention within the Python community, aiding quick identification of classes in a codebase.
